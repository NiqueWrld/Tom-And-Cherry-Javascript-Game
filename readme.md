# Tom & Jerry: *Catch Me If You Can!* 🐭💨  

Welcome to the *ultimate* game of cat and mouse! This project is a modern twist on the timeless rivalry of **Tom & Jerry**, where **you** are Tom, and your mission is simple: catch Jerry as he scurries all over your screen. Spoiler: Jerry is sneakier than he looks. 😜

## 🎮 About the Game  
Jerry refuses to be caught and is determined to show off his dance moves while dodging your cursor! With every click, your score climbs higher, but can you beat your **high score**? Beware: the closer you get, the more taunting Jerry becomes.  

## ✨ Features  
- **Dynamic Animation**: Jerry *runs*, *dances*, and mocks your efforts with witty comments.
- **High Score Tracking**: Your glorious achievements are saved (thank you, `localStorage`) for eternal bragging rights.  
- **Responsive UI**: Built for screens of all sizes so Jerry can dodge you on any device!  
- **Randomized Movement**: Jerry teleports to a random location every time you get close.  
- **Interactive Comments**: Encouraging (and sometimes sassy) messages to keep you engaged.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools  
Here's what I used to bring this chaos to life:  

### **Languages & Tools**
1. **HTML**: To structure the game and provide the foundation.  
2. **CSS**: For styling Jerry’s slick moves and the game environment (including a nostalgic cartoonish vibe).  
3. **JavaScript**:  
   - Event listeners to track your clicks and cursor movements.  
   - Dynamic DOM manipulation to make Jerry's antics come alive.  
   - A sprinkle of math to calculate Jerry's randomized movements.  
4. **localStorage**: Keeps track of your high score, so you never forget your finest moments.  

### **Creative Skills**  
- **Event Handling**: Cursor interactions and click events that drive the gameplay.  
- **Animations**: Swapping GIFs dynamically for Jerry’s "Run" and "Dance" stickers.  
- **Proximity Detection**: A clever function calculates if you’re getting too close to Jerry, making him *run for his life*!  
- **Game Logic**: A fully functional scoring and feedback system that updates in real-time.

## 😂 Why You'll Love It  
Because it’s *frustratingly fun*! 🎉 Whether you're reliving your childhood or just looking for a quick laugh, chasing Jerry is a riot. Warning: Jerry might be the most annoying mouse you've ever encountered (and that’s saying something).

So, what are you waiting for? Fire up the game and see if you have what it takes to catch that cheeky little mouse. Happy chasing! 🏃‍♂️🐭
